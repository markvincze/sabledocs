More info about the OIDC\n JWT token audience here:\n https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3 Note: if not specified,\n the Push endpoint URL will be used.\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nPlatformLogsSettings\nseverity\nOptional. The minimum severity level of Platform Logs that will be written.\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nIngestionDataSourceSettings\nCloudStorage\nPubSubAvroFormat\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nPublishRequest\ntopic\nRequired. The messages in the request will be published on this topic.\n Format is `projects/{project}/topics/{topic}`.\nmessages\nRequired. The messages to publish.\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nPublishResponse\nmessage_ids\nOptional. The server-assigned ID of each published message, in the same\n order as the messages in the request. IDs are guaranteed to be unique\n within the topic.\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nPubsubMessage\ndata\nOptional. The message data field. If this field is empty, the message must\n contain at least one attribute.\nattributes\nOptional. Attributes for this message. If this field is empty, the message\n must contain non-empty data. This can be used to filter messages on the\n subscription.\nmessage_id\nID of this message, assigned by the server when the message is published.\n Guaranteed to be unique within the topic. This value may be read by a\n subscriber that receives a `PubsubMessage` via a `Pull` call or a push\n delivery. It must not be populated by the publisher in a `Publish` call.\npublish_time\nThe time at which the message was published, populated by the server when\n it receives the `Publish` call. It must not be populated by the\n publisher in a `Publish` call.\nordering_key\nOptional. If non-empty, identifies related messages for which publish order\n should be respected. If a `Subscription` has `enable_message_ordering` set\n to `true`, messages published with the same non-empty `ordering_key` value\n will be delivered to subscribers in the order in which they are received by\n the Pub/Sub system. All `PubsubMessage`s published in a given\n `PublishRequest` must specify the same `ordering_key` value. For more\n information, see [ordering\n messages](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/ordering).\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nPushConfig\nPubsubWrapper\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nPullRequest\nsubscription\nRequired. The subscription from which messages should be pulled.\n Format is `projects/{project}/subscriptions/{sub}`.\nreturn_immediately\nOptional. If this field set to true, the system will respond immediately\n even if it there are no messages available to return in the `Pull`\n response. Otherwise, the system may wait (for a bounded amount of time)\n until at least one message is available, rather than returning no messages.\n Warning: setting this field to `true` is discouraged because it adversely\n impacts the performance of `Pull` operations. We recommend that users do\n not set this field.\nmax_messages\nRequired. The maximum number of messages to return for this request. Must\n be a positive integer. The Pub/Sub system may return fewer than the number\n specified.\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nPullResponse\nreceived_messages\nOptional. Received Pub/Sub messages. The list will be empty if there are no\n more messages available in the backlog, or if no messages could be returned\n before the request timeout. For JSON, the response can be entirely\n empty. The Pub/Sub system may return fewer than the `maxMessages` requested\n even if there are more messages available in the backlog.\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nPushConfig\npush_endpoint\nOptional. A URL locating the endpoint to which messages should be pushed.\n For example, a Webhook endpoint might use `https://example.com/push`.\nattributes\nOptional. Endpoint configuration attributes that can be used to control\n different aspects of the message delivery.\n\n The only currently supported attribute is `x-goog-version`, which you can\n use to change the format of the pushed message. This attribute\n indicates the version of the data expected by the endpoint. This\n controls the shape of the pushed message (i.e., its fields and metadata).\n\n If not present during the `CreateSubscription` call, it will default to\n the version of the Pub/Sub API used to make such call. If not present in a\n `ModifyPushConfig` call, its value will not be changed. `GetSubscription`\n calls will always return a valid version, even if the subscription was\n created without this attribute.\n\n The only supported values for the `x-goog-version` attribute are:\n\n * `v1beta1`: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API.\n * `v1` or `v1beta2`: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API.\n\n For example:\n `attributes { \"x-goog-version\": \"v1\" }`\noidc_token\nOptional. If specified, Pub/Sub will generate and attach an OIDC JWT\n token as an `Authorization` header in the HTTP request for every pushed\n message.\npubsub_wrapper\nOptional. When set, the payload to the push endpoint is in the form of\n the JSON representation of a PubsubMessage\n (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/rpc/google.pubsub.v1#pubsubmessage).\nno_wrapper\nOptional. When set, the payload to the push endpoint is not wrapped.\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nReceivedMessage\nack_id\nOptional. This ID can be used to acknowledge the received message.\nmessage\nOptional. The message.\ndelivery_attempt\nOptional. The approximate number of times that Pub/Sub has attempted to\n deliver the associated message to a subscriber.\n\n More precisely, this is 1 + (number of NACKs) +\n (number of ack_deadline exceeds) for this message.\n\n A NACK is any call to ModifyAckDeadline with a 0 deadline. An ack_deadline\n exceeds event is whenever a message is not acknowledged within\n ack_deadline. Note that ack_deadline is initially\n Subscription.ackDeadlineSeconds, but may get extended automatically by\n the client library.\n\n Upon the first delivery of a given message, `delivery_attempt` will have a\n value of 1. The value is calculated at best effort and is approximate.\n\n If a DeadLetterPolicy is not set on the subscription, this will be 0.\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nRetryPolicy\nminimum_backoff\nOptional. The minimum delay between consecutive deliveries of a given\n message. Value should be between 0 and 600 seconds. Defaults to 10 seconds.\nmaximum_backoff\nOptional.

Name of the schema.\n Format is `projects/{project}/schemas/{schema}`.\ntype\nThe type of the schema definition.\ndefinition\nThe definition of the schema. This should contain a string representing\n the full definition of the schema that is a valid schema definition of\n the type specified in `type`.\nrevision_id\nOutput only. Immutable. The revision ID of the schema.\nrevision_create_time\nOutput only. The timestamp that the revision was created.\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nSchemaSettings\nschema\nRequired.

The minimum (inclusive) revision allowed for validating messages.\n If empty or not present, allow any revision to be validated against\n last_revision or any revision created before.\nlast_revision_id\nOptional. The maximum (inclusive) revision allowed for validating messages.\n If empty or not present, allow any revision to be validated against\n first_revision or any revision created after.\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nIngestionFailureEvent\nSchemaViolationReason\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nSeekRequest\nsubscription\nRequired. The subscription to affect.\ntime\nOptional. The time to seek to.\n Messages retained in the subscription that were published before this\n time are marked as acknowledged, and messages retained in the\n subscription that were published after this time are marked as\n unacknowledged. Note that this operation affects only those messages\n retained in the subscription (configured by the combination of\n `message_retention_duration` and `retain_acked_messages`). For example,\n if `time` corresponds to a point before the message retention\n window (or to a point before the system's notion of the subscription\n creation time), only retained messages will be marked as unacknowledged,\n and already-expunged messages will not be restored.\nsnapshot\nOptional. The snapshot to seek to. The snapshot's topic must be the same\n as that of the provided subscription. Format is\n `projects/{project}/snapshots/{snap}`.\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nSeekResponse\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nSnapshot\nname\nOptional. The name of the snapshot.\ntopic\nOptional. The name of the topic from which this snapshot is retaining\n messages.\nexpire_time\nOptional. The snapshot is guaranteed to exist up until this time.\n A newly-created snapshot expires no later than 7 days from the time of its\n creation. Its exact lifetime is determined at creation by the existing\n backlog in the source subscription. Specifically, the lifetime of the\n snapshot is `7 days - (age of oldest unacked message in the subscription)`.\n For example, consider a subscription whose oldest unacked message is 3 days\n old. If a snapshot is created from this subscription, the snapshot -- which\n will always capture this 3-day-old backlog as long as the snapshot\n exists -- will expire in 4 days. The service will refuse to create a\n snapshot that would expire in less than 1 hour after creation.\nlabels\nOptional. See [Creating and managing labels]\n (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/labels).\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nStreamingPullRequest\nsubscription\nRequired. The subscription for which to initialize the new stream. This\n must be provided in the first request on the stream, and must not be set in\n subsequent requests from client to server.\n Format is `projects/{project}/subscriptions/{sub}`.\nack_ids\nOptional. List of acknowledgment IDs for acknowledging previously received\n messages (received on this stream or a different stream). If an ack ID has\n expired, the corresponding message may be redelivered later. Acknowledging\n a message more than once will not result in an error. If the acknowledgment\n ID is malformed, the stream will be aborted with status `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.\nmodify_deadline_seconds\nOptional. The list of new ack deadlines for the IDs listed in\n `modify_deadline_ack_ids`. The size of this list must be the same as the\n size of `modify_deadline_ack_ids`. If it differs the stream will be aborted\n with `INVALID_ARGUMENT`. Each element in this list is applied to the\n element in the same position in `modify_deadline_ack_ids`. The new ack\n deadline is with respect to the time this request was sent to the Pub/Sub\n system. Must be >= 0. For example, if the value is 10, the new ack deadline\n will expire 10 seconds after this request is received. If the value is 0,\n the message is immediately made available for another streaming or\n non-streaming pull request. If the value is < 0 (an error), the stream will\n be aborted with status `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.\nmodify_deadline_ack_ids\nOptional. List of acknowledgment IDs whose deadline will be modified based\n on the corresponding element in `modify_deadline_seconds`. This field can\n be used to indicate that more time is needed to process a message by the\n subscriber, or to make the message available for redelivery if the\n processing was interrupted.\nstream_ack_deadline_seconds\nRequired. The ack deadline to use for the stream. This must be provided in\n the first request on the stream, but it can also be updated on subsequent\n requests from client to server. The minimum deadline you can specify is 10\n seconds. The maximum deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).\nclient_id\nOptional. A unique identifier that is used to distinguish client instances\n from each other. Only needs to be provided on the initial request. When a\n stream disconnects and reconnects for the same stream, the client_id should\n be set to the same value so that state associated with the old stream can\n be transferred to the new stream. The same client_id should not be used for\n different client instances.\nmax_outstanding_messages\nOptional. Flow control settings for the maximum number of outstanding\n messages. When there are `max_outstanding_messages` currently sent to the\n streaming pull client that have not yet been acked or nacked, the server\n stops sending more messages. The sending of messages resumes once the\n number of outstanding messages is less than this value. If the value is\n <= 0, there is no limit to the number of outstanding messages. This\n property can only be set on the initial StreamingPullRequest. If it is set\n on a subsequent request, the stream will be aborted with status\n `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.\nmax_outstanding_bytes\nOptional. Flow control settings for the maximum number of outstanding\n bytes. When there are `max_outstanding_bytes` or more worth of messages\n currently sent to the streaming pull client that have not yet been acked or\n nacked, the server will stop sending more messages. The sending of messages\n resumes once the number of outstanding bytes is less than this value. If\n the value is <= 0, there is no limit to the number of outstanding bytes.\n This property can only be set on the initial StreamingPullRequest. If it is\n set on a subsequent request, the stream will be aborted with status\n `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nStreamingPullResponse\nreceived_messages\nOptional. Received Pub/Sub messages. This will not be empty.\nmodify_ack_deadline_confirmation\nOptional. This field will only be set if `enable_exactly_once_delivery` is\n set to `true` and is not guaranteed to be populated.\nsubscription_properties\nOptional. Properties associated with this subscription.\nacknowledge_confirmation\nOptional. This field will only be set if `enable_exactly_once_delivery` is\n set to `true` and is not guaranteed to be populated.\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nSubscription\nname\nRequired. The name of the subscription. It must have the format\n `\"projects/{project}/subscriptions/{subscription}\"`. `{subscription}` must\n start with a letter, and contain only letters (`[A-Za-z]`), numbers\n (`[0-9]`), dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), periods (`.`), tildes (`~`),\n plus (`+`) or percent signs (`%`). It must be between 3 and 255 characters\n in length, and it must not start with `\"goog\"`.\ntopic\nRequired. The name of the topic from which this subscription is receiving\n messages. Format is `projects/{project}/topics/{topic}`. The value of this\n field will be `_deleted-topic_` if the topic has been deleted.\npush_config\nOptional. If push delivery is used with this subscription, this field is\n used to configure it.\nack_deadline_seconds\nOptional. The approximate amount of time (on a best-effort basis) Pub/Sub\n waits for the subscriber to acknowledge receipt before resending the\n message. In the interval after the message is delivered and before it is\n acknowledged, it is considered to be _outstanding_. During that time\n period, the message will not be redelivered (on a best-effort basis).\n\n For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for the ack\n deadline. To override this value for a given message, call\n `ModifyAckDeadline` with the corresponding `ack_id` if using\n non-streaming pull or send the `ack_id` in a\n `StreamingModifyAckDeadlineRequest` if using streaming pull.\n The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds.\n The maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).\n If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used.\n\n For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout for\n the call to the push endpoint.\n\n If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub\n system will eventually redeliver the message.\nretain_acked_messages\nOptional. Indicates whether to retain acknowledged messages. If true, then\n messages are not expunged from the subscription's backlog, even if they are\n acknowledged, until they fall out of the `message_retention_duration`\n window. This must be true if you would like to [`Seek` to a timestamp]\n (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview#seek_to_a_time) in\n the past to replay previously-acknowledged messages.\nmessage_retention_duration\nOptional. How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's\n backlog, from the moment a message is published. If `retain_acked_messages`\n is true, then this also configures the retention of acknowledged messages,\n and thus configures how far back in time a `Seek` can be done. Defaults to\n 7 days. Cannot be more than 31 days or less than 10 minutes.\nlabels\nOptional. See [Creating and managing\n labels](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/labels).\nenable_message_ordering\nOptional. If true, messages published with the same `ordering_key` in\n `PubsubMessage` will be delivered to the subscribers in the order in which\n they are received by the Pub/Sub system. Otherwise, they may be delivered\n in any order.\nexpiration_policy\nOptional. A policy that specifies the conditions for this subscription's\n expiration. A subscription is considered active as long as any connected\n subscriber is successfully consuming messages from the subscription or is\n issuing operations on the subscription. If `expiration_policy` is not set,\n a *default policy* with `ttl` of 31 days will be used. The minimum allowed\n value for `expiration_policy.ttl` is 1 day. If `expiration_policy` is set,\n but `expiration_policy.ttl` is not set, the subscription never expires.\nfilter\nOptional. An expression written in the Pub/Sub [filter\n language](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/filtering). If non-empty,\n then only `PubsubMessage`s whose `attributes` field matches the filter are\n delivered on this subscription. If empty, then no messages are filtered\n out.\ndead_letter_policy\nOptional. A policy that specifies the conditions for dead lettering\n messages in this subscription. If dead_letter_policy is not set, dead\n lettering is disabled.\n\n The Pub/Sub service account associated with this subscriptions's\n parent project (i.e.,\n service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must have\n permission to Acknowledge() messages on this subscription.\nretry_policy\nOptional. A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery for\n this subscription.\n\n If not set, the default retry policy is applied. This generally implies\n that messages will be retried as soon as possible for healthy subscribers.\n RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgment deadline exceeded\n events for a given message.\ndetached\nOptional. Indicates whether the subscription is detached from its topic.\n Detached subscriptions don't receive messages from their topic and don't\n retain any backlog. `Pull` and `StreamingPull` requests will return\n FAILED_PRECONDITION. If the subscription is a push subscription, pushes to\n the endpoint will not be made.\nenable_exactly_once_delivery\nOptional. If true, Pub/Sub provides the following guarantees for the\n delivery of a message with a given value of `message_id` on this\n subscription:\n\n * The message sent to a subscriber is guaranteed not to be resent\n before the message's acknowledgment deadline expires.\n * An acknowledged message will not be resent to a subscriber.\n\n Note that subscribers may still receive multiple copies of a message\n when `enable_exactly_once_delivery` is true if the message was published\n multiple times by a publisher client. These copies are  considered distinct\n by Pub/Sub and have distinct `message_id` values.\ntopic_message_retention_duration\nOutput only. Indicates the minimum duration for which a message is retained\n after it is published to the subscription's topic. If this field is set,\n messages published to the subscription's topic in the last\n `topic_message_retention_duration` are always available to subscribers. See\n the `message_retention_duration` field in `Topic`. This field is set only\n in responses from the server; it is ignored if it is set in any requests.\nbigquery_config\nOptional. If delivery to BigQuery is used with this subscription, this\n field is used to configure it.\nstate\nOutput only. An output-only field indicating whether or not the\n subscription can receive messages.\ncloud_storage_config\nOptional. If delivery to Google Cloud Storage is used with this\n subscription, this field is used to configure it.\nanalytics_hub_subscription_info\nOutput only. Information about the associated Analytics Hub subscription.\n Only set if the subscritpion is created by Analytics Hub.\nmessage_transforms\nOptional. Transforms to be applied to messages before they are delivered to\n subscribers. Transforms are applied in the order specified.\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nStreamingPullResponse\nSubscriptionProperties\nexactly_once_delivery_enabled\nOptional. True iff exactly once delivery is enabled for this\n subscription.\nmessage_ordering_enabled\nOptional.

This field is set only in responses from\n the server; it is ignored if it is set in any requests.\nmessage_retention_duration\nOptional. Indicates the minimum duration to retain a message after it is\n published to the topic. If this field is set, messages published to the\n topic in the last `message_retention_duration` are always available to\n subscribers. For instance, it allows any attached subscription to [seek to\n a\n timestamp](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview#seek_to_a_time)\n that is up to `message_retention_duration` in the past. If this field is\n not set, message retention is controlled by settings on individual\n subscriptions. Cannot be more than 31 days or less than 10 minutes.\nstate\nOutput only. An output-only field indicating the state of the topic.\ningestion_data_source_settings\nOptional. Settings for ingestion from a data source into this topic.\nmessage_transforms\nOptional.
