The name of the subscription.\n Format is `projects/{project}/subscriptions/{sub}`.\nack_deadline_seconds\nRequired. The new ack deadline with respect to the time this request was\n sent to the Pub/Sub system. For example, if the value is 10, the new ack\n deadline will expire 10 seconds after the `ModifyAckDeadline` call was\n made. Specifying zero might immediately make the message available for\n delivery to another subscriber client. This typically results in an\n increase in the rate of message redeliveries (that is, duplicates).\n The minimum deadline you can specify is 0 seconds.\n The maximum deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).\nack_ids\nRequired. List of acknowledgment IDs.\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nModifyPushConfigRequest\nsubscription\nRequired. The name of the subscription.\n Format is `projects/{project}/subscriptions/{sub}`.\npush_config\nRequired.

If this field is empty, the message must contain\n at least one attribute.\nattributes\nAttributes for this message. If this field is empty, the message must\n contain non-empty data. This can be used to filter messages on the\n subscription.\nmessage_id\nID of this message, assigned by the server when the message is published.\n Guaranteed to be unique within the topic. This value may be read by a\n subscriber that receives a `PubsubMessage` via a `Pull` call or a push\n delivery. It must not be populated by the publisher in a `Publish` call.\npublish_time\nThe time at which the message was published, populated by the server when\n it receives the `Publish` call. It must not be populated by the\n publisher in a `Publish` call.\nordering_key\nIf non-empty, identifies related messages for which publish order should be\n respected. If a `Subscription` has `enable_message_ordering` set to `true`,\n messages published with the same non-empty `ordering_key` value will be\n delivered to subscribers in the order in which they are received by the\n Pub/Sub system. All `PubsubMessage`s published in a given `PublishRequest`\n must specify the same `ordering_key` value.\n For more information, see [ordering\n messages](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/ordering).\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nPullRequest\nsubscription\nRequired. The subscription from which messages should be pulled.\n Format is `projects/{project}/subscriptions/{sub}`.\nreturn_immediately\nOptional. If this field set to true, the system will respond immediately\n even if it there are no messages available to return in the `Pull`\n response. Otherwise, the system may wait (for a bounded amount of time)\n until at least one message is available, rather than returning no messages.\n Warning: setting this field to `true` is discouraged because it adversely\n impacts the performance of `Pull` operations. We recommend that users do\n not set this field.\nmax_messages\nRequired. The maximum number of messages to return for this request. Must\n be a positive integer. The Pub/Sub system may return fewer than the number\n specified.\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nPullResponse\nreceived_messages\nReceived Pub/Sub messages. The list will be empty if there are no more\n messages available in the backlog, or if no messages could be returned\n before the request timeout. For JSON, the response can be entirely\n empty. The Pub/Sub system may return fewer than the `maxMessages` requested\n even if there are more messages available in the backlog.\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nPushConfig\npush_endpoint\nA URL locating the endpoint to which messages should be pushed.\n For example, a Webhook endpoint might use `https://example.com/push`.\nattributes\nEndpoint configuration attributes that can be used to control different\n aspects of the message delivery.\n\n The only currently supported attribute is `x-goog-version`, which you can\n use to change the format of the pushed message. This attribute\n indicates the version of the data expected by the endpoint. This\n controls the shape of the pushed message (i.e., its fields and metadata).\n\n If not present during the `CreateSubscription` call, it will default to\n the version of the Pub/Sub API used to make such call. If not present in a\n `ModifyPushConfig` call, its value will not be changed. `GetSubscription`\n calls will always return a valid version, even if the subscription was\n created without this attribute.\n\n The only supported values for the `x-goog-version` attribute are:\n\n * `v1beta1`: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API.\n * `v1` or `v1beta2`: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API.\n\n For example:\n `attributes { \"x-goog-version\": \"v1\" }`\noidc_token\nIf specified, Pub/Sub will generate and attach an OIDC JWT token as an\n `Authorization` header in the HTTP request for every pushed message.\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nReceivedMessage\nack_id\nThis ID can be used to acknowledge the received message.\nmessage\nThe message.\ndelivery_attempt\nThe approximate number of times that Cloud Pub/Sub has attempted to deliver\n the associated message to a subscriber.\n\n More precisely, this is 1 + (number of NACKs) +\n (number of ack_deadline exceeds) for this message.\n\n A NACK is any call to ModifyAckDeadline with a 0 deadline. An ack_deadline\n exceeds event is whenever a message is not acknowledged within\n ack_deadline. Note that ack_deadline is initially\n Subscription.ackDeadlineSeconds, but may get extended automatically by\n the client library.\n\n Upon the first delivery of a given message, `delivery_attempt` will have a\n value of 1.

If empty\n or not present, allow any revision to be validated against last_revision or\n any revision created before.\nlast_revision_id\nThe maximum (inclusive) revision allowed for validating messages. If empty\n or not present, allow any revision to be validated against first_revision\n or any revision created after.\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nSeekRequest\nsubscription\nRequired. The subscription to affect.\ntime\nThe time to seek to.\n Messages retained in the subscription that were published before this\n time are marked as acknowledged, and messages retained in the\n subscription that were published after this time are marked as\n unacknowledged. Note that this operation affects only those messages\n retained in the subscription (configured by the combination of\n `message_retention_duration` and `retain_acked_messages`). For example,\n if `time` corresponds to a point before the message retention\n window (or to a point before the system's notion of the subscription\n creation time), only retained messages will be marked as unacknowledged,\n and already-expunged messages will not be restored.\nsnapshot\nThe snapshot to seek to. The snapshot's topic must be the same as that of\n the provided subscription.\n Format is `projects/{project}/snapshots/{snap}`.\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nSeekResponse\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nSnapshot\nname\nThe name of the snapshot.\ntopic\nThe name of the topic from which this snapshot is retaining messages.\nexpire_time\nThe snapshot is guaranteed to exist up until this time.\n A newly-created snapshot expires no later than 7 days from the time of its\n creation. Its exact lifetime is determined at creation by the existing\n backlog in the source subscription. Specifically, the lifetime of the\n snapshot is `7 days - (age of oldest unacked message in the subscription)`.\n For example, consider a subscription whose oldest unacked message is 3 days\n old. If a snapshot is created from this subscription, the snapshot -- which\n will always capture this 3-day-old backlog as long as the snapshot\n exists -- will expire in 4 days. The service will refuse to create a\n snapshot that would expire in less than 1 hour after creation.\nlabels\nSee [Creating and managing labels]\n (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/labels).\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nStreamingPullRequest\nsubscription\nRequired. The subscription for which to initialize the new stream. This\n must be provided in the first request on the stream, and must not be set in\n subsequent requests from client to server.\n Format is `projects/{project}/subscriptions/{sub}`.\nack_ids\nList of acknowledgement IDs for acknowledging previously received messages\n (received on this stream or a different stream). If an ack ID has expired,\n the corresponding message may be redelivered later. Acknowledging a message\n more than once will not result in an error. If the acknowledgement ID is\n malformed, the stream will be aborted with status `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.\nmodify_deadline_seconds\nThe list of new ack deadlines for the IDs listed in\n `modify_deadline_ack_ids`. The size of this list must be the same as the\n size of `modify_deadline_ack_ids`. If it differs the stream will be aborted\n with `INVALID_ARGUMENT`. Each element in this list is applied to the\n element in the same position in `modify_deadline_ack_ids`. The new ack\n deadline is with respect to the time this request was sent to the Pub/Sub\n system. Must be >= 0. For example, if the value is 10, the new ack deadline\n will expire 10 seconds after this request is received. If the value is 0,\n the message is immediately made available for another streaming or\n non-streaming pull request. If the value is < 0 (an error), the stream will\n be aborted with status `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.\nmodify_deadline_ack_ids\nList of acknowledgement IDs whose deadline will be modified based on the\n corresponding element in `modify_deadline_seconds`. This field can be used\n to indicate that more time is needed to process a message by the\n subscriber, or to make the message available for redelivery if the\n processing was interrupted.\nstream_ack_deadline_seconds\nRequired. The ack deadline to use for the stream. This must be provided in\n the first request on the stream, but it can also be updated on subsequent\n requests from client to server. The minimum deadline you can specify is 10\n seconds. The maximum deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).\nclient_id\nA unique identifier that is used to distinguish client instances from each\n other. Only needs to be provided on the initial request. When a stream\n disconnects and reconnects for the same stream, the client_id should be set\n to the same value so that state associated with the old stream can be\n transferred to the new stream. The same client_id should not be used for\n different client instances.\nmax_outstanding_messages\nFlow control settings for the maximum number of outstanding messages. When\n there are `max_outstanding_messages` or more currently sent to the\n streaming pull client that have not yet been acked or nacked, the server\n stops sending more messages. The sending of messages resumes once the\n number of outstanding messages is less than this value. If the value is\n <= 0, there is no limit to the number of outstanding messages. This\n property can only be set on the initial StreamingPullRequest. If it is set\n on a subsequent request, the stream will be aborted with status\n `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.\nmax_outstanding_bytes\nFlow control settings for the maximum number of outstanding bytes. When\n there are `max_outstanding_bytes` or more worth of messages currently sent\n to the streaming pull client that have not yet been acked or nacked, the\n server will stop sending more messages. The sending of messages resumes\n once the number of outstanding bytes is less than this value. If the value\n is <= 0, there is no limit to the number of outstanding bytes. This\n property can only be set on the initial StreamingPullRequest. If it is set\n on a subsequent request, the stream will be aborted with status\n `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.\ngoogle\npubsub\nv1\nStreamingPullResponse\nreceived_messages\nReceived Pub/Sub messages.

The name of the subscription. It must have the format\n `\"projects/{project}/subscriptions/{subscription}\"`. `{subscription}` must\n start with a letter, and contain only letters (`[A-Za-z]`), numbers\n (`[0-9]`), dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), periods (`.`), tildes (`~`),\n plus (`+`) or percent signs (`%`). It must be between 3 and 255 characters\n in length, and it must not start with `\"goog\"`.\ntopic\nRequired. The name of the topic from which this subscription is receiving\n messages. Format is `projects/{project}/topics/{topic}`. The value of this\n field will be `_deleted-topic_` if the topic has been deleted.\npush_config\nIf push delivery is used with this subscription, this field is\n used to configure it.\nack_deadline_seconds\nThe approximate amount of time (on a best-effort basis) Pub/Sub waits for\n the subscriber to acknowledge receipt before resending the message. In the\n interval after the message is delivered and before it is acknowledged, it\n is considered to be _outstanding_. During that time period, the\n message will not be redelivered (on a best-effort basis).\n\n For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for the ack\n deadline. To override this value for a given message, call\n `ModifyAckDeadline` with the corresponding `ack_id` if using\n non-streaming pull or send the `ack_id` in a\n `StreamingModifyAckDeadlineRequest` if using streaming pull.\n The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds.\n The maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).\n If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used.\n\n For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout for\n the call to the push endpoint.\n\n If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub\n system will eventually redeliver the message.\nretain_acked_messages\nIndicates whether to retain acknowledged messages. If true, then\n messages are not expunged from the subscription's backlog, even if they are\n acknowledged, until they fall out of the `message_retention_duration`\n window. This must be true if you would like to [`Seek` to a timestamp]\n (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview#seek_to_a_time) in\n the past to replay previously-acknowledged messages.\nmessage_retention_duration\nHow long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's backlog,\n from the moment a message is published.\n If `retain_acked_messages` is true, then this also configures the retention\n of acknowledged messages, and thus configures how far back in time a `Seek`\n can be done. Defaults to 7 days. Cannot be more than 7 days or less than 10\n minutes.\nlabels\nSee [Creating and managing\n labels](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/labels).\nenable_message_ordering\nIf true, messages published with the same `ordering_key` in `PubsubMessage`\n will be delivered to the subscribers in the order in which they\n are received by the Pub/Sub system. Otherwise, they may be delivered in\n any order.\nexpiration_policy\nA policy that specifies the conditions for this subscription's expiration.\n A subscription is considered active as long as any connected subscriber is\n successfully consuming messages from the subscription or is issuing\n operations on the subscription. If `expiration_policy` is not set, a\n *default policy* with `ttl` of 31 days will be used. The minimum allowed\n value for `expiration_policy.ttl` is 1 day. If `expiration_policy` is set,\n but `expiration_policy.ttl` is not set, the subscription never expires.\nfilter\nAn expression written in the Pub/Sub [filter\n language](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/filtering). If non-empty,\n then only `PubsubMessage`s whose `attributes` field matches the filter are\n delivered on this subscription. If empty, then no messages are filtered\n out.\ndead_letter_policy\nA policy that specifies the conditions for dead lettering messages in\n this subscription. If dead_letter_policy is not set, dead lettering\n is disabled.\n\n The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated with this subscriptions's\n parent project (i.e.,\n service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must have\n permission to Acknowledge() messages on this subscription.\nretry_policy\nA policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery for this\n subscription.\n\n If not set, the default retry policy is applied. This generally implies\n that messages will be retried as soon as possible for healthy subscribers.\n RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline\n exceeded events for a given message.\ndetached\nIndicates whether the subscription is detached from its topic. Detached\n subscriptions don't receive messages from their topic and don't retain any\n backlog. `Pull` and `StreamingPull` requests will return\n FAILED_PRECONDITION. If the subscription is a push subscription, pushes to\n the endpoint will not be made.\nenable_exactly_once_delivery\nIf true, Pub/Sub provides the following guarantees for the delivery of\n a message with a given value of `message_id` on this subscription:\n\n * The message sent to a subscriber is guaranteed not to be resent\n before the message's acknowledgement deadline expires.\n * An acknowledged message will not be resent to a subscriber.\n\n Note that subscribers may still receive multiple copies of a message\n when `enable_exactly_once_delivery` is true if the message was published\n multiple times by a publisher client. These copies are  considered distinct\n by Pub/Sub and have distinct `message_id` values.\ntopic_message_retention_duration\nOutput only. Indicates the minimum duration for which a message is retained\n after it is published to the subscription's topic. If this field is set,\n messages published to the subscription's topic in the last\n `topic_message_retention_duration` are always available to subscribers. See\n the `message_retention_duration` field in `Topic`. This field is set only\n in responses from the server; it is ignored if it is set in any requests.\nbigquery_config\nIf delivery to BigQuery is used with this subscription, this field is\n used to configure it.\nstate\nOutput only.

If this field is set, messages published to the topic in the\n last `message_retention_duration` are always available to subscribers. For\n instance, it allows any attached subscription to [seek to a\n timestamp](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview#seek_to_a_time)\n that is up to `message_retention_duration` in the past. If this field is\n not set, message retention is controlled by settings on individual\n subscriptions.
